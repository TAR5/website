# Damus PWA 

Here lies the code for the Damus web app, a client for the Nostr protocol. The
goal of this client is to be a better version of Twitter, but not to reproduce
all of it's functionality.

## Contribution Guide

There are rules to contributing to this client. Please ensure you read them 
before making changes and supplying patch notes.

1. No transpilers. All source code should work out of the box.
2. Keep source code organised. Refer to the folder structure. If you have a
   question, ask it.
3. Do not include your personal tools in the source code. Use your own scripts
   outside of the project. This does not include build tools such as Make.
4. Spaces, no tabs.
5. Do not include binary files.
6. No NPM (and kin) environments. If you need a file from an external resource
   mark the location in the "sources" file and add it to the repo.
7. Do not write code using experimental browser APIs.
8. Do not write animations in JavaScript, CSS only. Keep them short and snappy.
   Animations should not be a forefront, but an enjoyable addition.
9. All new & modified code should be properly documented.
10. Source code should be readable in the browser.

TODO Write about code style requirements & add number of spaces.
